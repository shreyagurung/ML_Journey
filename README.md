# ML_Journey

I will be documentinng the different programs that I will be implementing on my Machine Learning journey.

### Programs
1. [A basic Linear regression with no learning](https://github.com/shreyagurung/ML_Journey/blob/master/Linear_Regression.py)
2. [A KNN program](https://github.com/shreyagurung/ML_Journey/blob/master/kNN/kNN.py) on the Animal's Dataset given by Adrian Rosebrock
3. [A simple Logistic Regression](https://github.com/shreyagurung/ML_Journey/blob/master/LogisticRegression.py) and a few pointers and [explanation of the code](https://github.com/shreyagurung/ML_Journey/blob/master/LogisticRegression.md).
4. [A simple Gradient Descent program](https://github.com/shreyagurung/ML_Journey/blob/master/SimpleGradientDescent.py)
5. [A Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/shreyagurung/ML_Journey/blob/master/Convolutional_Neural_Network/Convolutional_Network.py) example to recognise build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem on the SIGNS dataset
